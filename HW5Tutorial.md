# BENG 183 HW5 Tutorial
Special thanks to Jingtian Zhou who wrote the original version of this homework in 2020. This tutorial is written to explain methods for solving the adapted version for the 2022 course.

## Preparation

Similar to HW4, this homework can be completed in a variety of programming languages such as R or Matlab, however this tutorial will focus on Python. See the links for installing python and jupyter from the HW4 tutorial, which can be found [here](HW4Tutorial.md).
